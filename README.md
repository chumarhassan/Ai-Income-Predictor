🧩 Introduction

AI Income Predictor is a machine learning-powered desktop app that predicts whether a user's income is likely to be <= $50K or > $50K per year based on demographic and socio-economic inputs. It offers insightful recommendations and visualizations to help users understand and potentially improve their income profile.

✨ Features

- Income Prediction using ML
- User-Friendly GUI (Tkinter)
- Visualizations: feature importance, histograms, confusion matrix
- Confidence Score and estimated income range
- Personalized recommendations
- Prediction history storage
- Dark mode GUI

🔍 How It Works

- Data Cleaning: handles missing values and encodes categoricals
- Model: Random Forest Classifier (trained with GridSearchCV)
- Prediction: Provides probability and estimated income bracket
- Recommendations: Rule-based tips based on user input and feature impact

⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Income-Predictor.git
2. Create and activate virtual environment
3. Install packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
4. Download and place adult.csv in project root

🚀 Usage

Run: python income_predictor.py
- Input data via GUI
- Click "Predict My Income"
- View prediction, probability, and recommendations

📁 Project Structure

- adult.csv: dataset
- income_model.pkl: trained model
- prediction_history.csv: local prediction logs
- income_predictor.py: main application script

📊 Data Source

Uses the Adult Income Dataset from the UCI ML Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

📉 Visualizations

- Feature Importance
- Probability Histogram
- Confusion Matrix
- Correlation Heatmap
- Cumulative Probability Plot

⚠️ Limitations

- Static dataset (no real-time updates)
